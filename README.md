# WARNING
THE ENGINE IS AT A VERY UNSTABLE STATE AT THE MOMENT, IT HAS NO MODDING SUPPORT YET.
IF YOU WANNA MAKE A MOD WITH THE ENGINE AS OF NOW, YOU WILL HAVE TO MODIFY THE SOURCE CODE.

# NOTICE
If you are getting an issue with random crashes without no error messages, update your hxcpp with `haxelib update hxcpp` or use the bleeding edge version (not recommended) via `haxelib git hxcpp https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hxcpp master`.
